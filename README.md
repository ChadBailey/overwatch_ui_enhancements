# Idea: Inventory Management - Favorites & Kits

I have several ideas about how the interface for Overwatch could be improved with minimal effort and big improvements to the end user. These changes also have a hidden benefits to Blizzard that I will explain at the end, so it is a win-win-win (inexpensive, better for the users, better for the company) :)

## Easily View New and Added Items

When a new patch is dropped, it would be super cool to be able to easily see all of the event items added to the game. Most players I know either do this manually or look for the list online - the ability to do this in-game would be nice! While you're at it, it would be cool to also be able to see all of the "New" items in a single page, rather than having to visit each hero to find them individually. Here is a preview of how this could look

### As-Is

### Proposed

> I did not have the time/patience to mock-up the menu, but ideally when you click either button it will give you a single page with a scrollable list of the new or event items respectively.

## Favorite Items and Heros

In the hero gallery it would be nice to have the ability to flag items based on preference. Where there is not currently a right-click menu, one could be added to "Add to favoites" "Remove from favorites" respectively. The only purpose of this would be for sorting, but it would help managing inventory a _lot_.

Not shown in the below mockup is the ability to add favorite heros. It would be nice to have the same favoriting system for heros to sort favorite heros first in the gallery.

> IMPORTANT: Adding or removing items from favorites should be supported whether or not the player has the item. This will allow the player the ability to more easily find the items they intended to buy using their credits once earned.

## Hero Kits

This change is admittedly on the expensive end of the spectrum when it comes to my suggestions, but I do think the payoff would be immense. Rather than picking skins in the player select screen, perhaps we could pick kits which are set up by the user ahead of time. Each kit would have stored in it the items the user added to the kit.

### Bonus Benefits

Blizzard could use this data on the players' item preferences to better understand what players like and don't like. While one could argue that this information can already be inferred by the selection rate of the items, this would result in much more data to work with as well as cleaner data.

Additionally, the better the inventory management system is, the more players will desire more items and therefore purchase loot boxes :)
